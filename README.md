Applying Data Science to 2008 Democratic Primaries â€“ Clinton vs. Obama

This was a Team Project I encountered during the Data Science course of my MQM Business Analytics Program, where we had to use unsupervised and supervised modeling tools to study the election data in the middle of the 2008 Democratic Primaries battle between Clinton and Obama and predict pending election results.

Refer to the ObamaClintonVoters pdf file to learn more about the case, and DEC520Q_Team2_Case3 pdf and R files to study our submissions.
